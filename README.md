# WhiteCore Sim

*NOTE:
 As of today, we have included BulletSim into the repository as a second Physics Engine. Please try it out and tell us if it's working properly*

*NOTE:
 As of Version 0.9.3, it's advised to Linux users to use a Mono version higher then 3.2.8, following a report about GC.Collect() not cleaning up memory correctly. The most current version of Mono is 3.10 (Released 4th November 2014)*

 More information can be found here: http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/

*NOTE: 
 As of Version 0.9.2, the WhiteCore repository format has changed.  
 The WhiteCore-Optional-Modules repository has also been updated for the new structure.
 To ensure correct compiling, use the latest commits of the WhiteCore-Dev or a release version >= 0.9.2*

*Please see the "Migration to 0.9.2.txt" file for details on files and configurations that will need to be modified*

The WhiteCore Development Team has begun the continuation of Aurora virtual world server.

The WhiteCore server is an OpenSim/Aurora-Sim derived project with heavy emphasis on supporting all users, 
increased technology focus, heavy emphasis on working with other developers,
whether it be viewer based developers or server based developers, 
and a set of features around stability and simplified usability for users.
