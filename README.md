*NOTE:
 As of today, we have included BulletSim into the repository as a second Physics Engine. Please try it out and tell us if it's working properly*

*NOTE:
 As of Version 0.9.3, it's advised to Linux users to use a Mono version higher then 3.2.8, following a report about GC.Collect() not cleaning up memory correctly. The most current version of Mono is 4.0.1 (Released 28th April 2015)*

 More information can be found here: http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/

The WhiteCore Development Team has begun the continuation of Aurora virtual world server.

The WhiteCore server is an OpenSim/Aurora-Sim derived project with heavy emphasis on supporting all users, 
increased technology focus, heavy emphasis on working with other developers,
whether it be viewer based developers or server based developers, 
and a set of features around stability and simplified usability for users.

## Configuration
*To see how to configure WhiteCore, look at "Setting up WhiteCore.txt" in the WhiteCoreDocs folder for more information*

Windows:
   Run the 'runprebuild.bat' file.
   This will check you current system configuration, compile the correct Visual Studio 2010 soultion and project files and prompt you to build immediately (if desired)

*nix: (Also OSX)
   Execute the 'runprebuild.sh' form a terminal or console shell.
   You will be prompted for your desired configuration, the appropriate solution and project files for Mono will be compiled and finally, prompt you to build immediately (if desired)
   
OSX:
   Run the 'runprebuild.command' shell command by 'double clicking' in Finder.
   You will be prompted for your desired configuration, the appropriate solution and project files for Mono will be compiled and finally, prompt you to build immediately (if desired)
   	   
## Compiling WhiteCore
*To compile WhiteCore, look at the Compiling.txt in the WhiteCoreDocs folder for more information*

*NOTE:
  For Windows 7 and 8, when compiling, you may see some warnings indicating that the core library does not match what is specified.
  This is an issue with how Microsoft provides the Net 4.5 packages and can be safely ignored as Windows will actually use the correct library when WhiteCore is run *
