Some people will find it very easy to run WhiteCore-Sim.  It is easy for the most part.
While running WHiteCore-Sim and configuring it is simple for some the network and port forwarding
is harder.  This tutorial will help you learn how to make sure your network is forwarding the proper
ports both in your firewall and your gateway (router/ modem).  The methods in this tutorial have been
tested and fully work.  If you follow this guide you should be up and going in no item at all.
  To setup WhiteCore-Sim please see the Setting up WhiteCore.txt
  If you are using development code and need to compile first please follow the instructions
in Compiling.txt for your system before continuing on with configuring WhiteCore-Sim.

## Opening Ports in Windows Firewall
##
  In order to get your viewer and your consoles communicating you need to open ports in your
Windows firewall first.  For most Windows users this will be pretty quick and simple.
  Follow these steps for your Windows firewall:
      1. Click Start -> Control Panel.
      2. Click on Windows Firewall.
      3. In the Windows Firewall click on Advanced Settings.
      4. In Advanced settings you will see Inbound Ports and Outbound Ports.
      5. First click on Inbound Ports.
      6. Now click on New Rule
      7. A wizard will open up. Select Ports
      8. Select TCP and enter 8002-8013 and click next.
      9. Next you will be given the option to allow connection.  Make sure this is checked.
      10. Next you will get an option to set this rule for Domain, Public, and Private. Check all 3.
      11. Last you will be asked to name the rule.  It is easiest to use Incoming Ports 8002-8013TCP.
      12. Also in the description it is helpful to add what the ports are for. such as grid ports.
      13. Click Finish.
   Now repeat these steps for the region ports beginning at port 9000TCP.  Also repeat this step for
the Inbound UDP ports.
   TO set the Outbound TCP and UDP ports its the same process as above.  Once this is done your firewall
is set for Windows Firewall.  On to the Gateway stuff.......
   NOTE for Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 users.  You have to put the ports in as follows:
   8002, 8003, 8004, 8005, 8006, 8007, 8008, 8009, 8010, 8011, 8012, 8013
   This will make sure the firewall accepts the rule in Windows 2008 Server and Windows 2008 Server R2.

## Port forwarding in your Network Gateway (modem/ router)
##
  For many people today the new internet modems given by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) also will act
  as a Network Gateway and firewall to block ports.  So you must also ensure the ports used for WhiteCore are
  unblocked here as well.  Because there are so many different routers and modems out there here I will encourage
  you to consult your router/ modem user manual on how to forward the ports.  Remember even if your doing a
  local grid only if you have followed the instructions in Opening ports in Windows Firewall and you still
  cannot connect,, this most likely will be the culprit.  To bind the ports to your machine's internal IP address
  in your local network it is best to use a static IP.  Please see setting up static IP below to learn how to
  accomplish this.

##
## Changing your Internal IP to Static
##
  When many people here the term Static IP they think you have to purchase this from your ISP.  
  For your external IP address to be static this is true.  However you can get a FQDN for this at
  DynDNS.com or ddns.net.  They will give you one FQDN subdomain such as you.dyndns.org or you.ddns.net for free.
  After you have obtained a FQDN you can usually insert this in your Modem/ Gateway depending on your router.
  Again consult your modem/ router manuel for the instructions on how to accomplish this. 
	  
  To establish and give your machine a static ip address on your local network on Windows is very simple.
  To do this follow these steps.
      1. Right click on your internet network icon in the lower right hand corner of your desktop.
      2. In the menu that appears select "Open Network and Sharing Center".
      3. In the Network and Sharing Center click on "Change Adapter Settings"
      4. Double click on your eithernet adapter.
      5. In your Ethernet Adapter window select the Properties button.
      6. In the Properties window that appears highlight Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and click Properties.
      7. In the window that appears tick the circle that says "Use the following IP" and enter as follows (replacing the xxx with your own numeric values):
         IP Address: 192.168.x.xxx
         Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
         Default Gateway: 192.168.x.x
         NOTE: Default gateway is the default gateway assigned by your modem or router.  You can get this from your ISP provider or consult your modem/ router manual.  It usually is 192.168.0.1 or in some cases 192.168.1.1, etc)
      8. After completing step 7, select the "Use the following DNS server addresses (if not already selected) and enter the IP address of the DNS servers provided by your ISP.
      9. After completing step 7 and 8 click OK for each window.  If you have done this correctly your IP address for your machine will now have a static IP in your network
  NOTE: If your server is being hosted in a Datacenter you do not need an internal static IP as this is already done.
  
  That is it.  Now if you have followed these instructions and the instructions for port forwarding in your gateway's user
  manual, your WhiteCoreSim should not have any trouble at all connecting to your viewer or WhiteCore.exe having trouble
  connecting to WhiteCore.Server.exe.  It is also recommended and encouraged that once you change your machine's IP address in your ethernet adapter you should reboot the machine to ensure everything works properly.

## FAQ
##
  Q: I don't have a Network Gateway and my Modem does not do port forwarding, what do I do?
  A: If this is the case then if you follow the steps for giving your tower a static IP and opening the ports
     in Windows Firewall you should not have any issues.

  Q: I followed these instructions and the instructions in my modem's user manual but it still doesn't connect, Why?
  A: First double check you didn't mistype something or get the wrong setting.  If this does not work you can ask
     for assistance.  I am happy to help.  Just email your issue to secondgalaxy2013@gmail.com or you can often
     find me in #whitecore-support on Libera.chat.
