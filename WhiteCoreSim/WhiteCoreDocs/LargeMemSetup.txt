WHY ?
An application running in 32Bit Mode on Windows can only access access 2GB Ram Total by default. As seen with WhiteCore, this
can can easily be reached when you throw in enough prims, scripts & users.  The Solution is to patch the EXE to make it aware
and to adjust 32-Bit windows to accomodate that (x64 is already capable).

When a 32-bit application is Large Address Aware, it can access up to 4GB on x64 operating systems and up to 3GB on x86.
64-bit Windows, require no modifications to the operating system to benefit from the Patched EXE files.
32-bit Windows, require some adjustments and they vary according to Version of Windows.
Linux/Mono do not appear affected by Large Address Aware patched exe's *** Still needs thorough verification. ***

How-To Patch EXE

Method 1)

    If you have Visual Studio 2008/2010 and/or C++ Express
    COPY your WhiteCore.exe to a safe place (backup)
    Copy again to a separate Working Directory (the ones you will patch)
    Open a Command Prompt (CMD) and change directory to that working dir
    run Following Command:  WhiteCore.exe

Method 2)  (maybe simpler and does not require C++ be installed)

    Above has an APPLICATION in the first posting which makes patching your executables easy.

    *** WARNING - FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS AND BACKUP BACKUP BACKUP ! ***
    ******************************************************************

WIN-XP
    Ensure you have View All Files & System Files enabled.
    In the root of C:\ you will see a file named "boot.ini"  MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF IT somewhere safe !
    Edit it with NotePad (you must be admin priviledged) and ADD the /3GB switch as shown below

    It will look similar to this example:

    [boot loader]
    timeout=30
    default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(2)\WINNT
    [operating systems]
    multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(2)\WINNT="????" /3GB

    Where: "????" in the example can be the programmatic name of the operating system versions shown below:
    Windows XP Professional / Windows Server 2003 / Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition / Windows Server 2003 Datacenter Edition.

WIN-VISTA
    Vista uses BCDedit.  A powerful yet potentially Very dangerous tool !
    Open a Command Prompt (CMD)
    Make a New Directory to preserve a BACKUP of the System Store & change dir there.
    Example: md c:\BCDbackup    then   cd c:\BCDbackup
    NEXT
       run the follow command IN BCDbackup:  bcdedit /export MyFileName
       Where MyFileName is something simple like MyBCD
    NEXT
       run the following command:  BCDEDIT /Set INCREASEUSERVA 3072
       NOTE: That is the Maximum assuming you have that much RAM and don't even try to make it more, the result would be not pleasant.

    !! RESTORING IN CASE OF ISSUES !!
    The following command imports the data from C:\Data\BCD Backup into the system store:
    bcdedit /import "c:\BCDbackup\MyBCD"

WIN-7  (Nothing Required, support is already there and better implemented)


*** CLOSING NOTES ***
*********************
By Patching the EXE files, they will use up to 4GB Ram on 64Bit or 3GB on 32bit.  This will not force
the system and won't cause harm if the the system does not have the RAM.

Modifying Win-XP & Vista (especially Vista) is a risk you have to measure for yourself.  These are well documented
and known to work as you can see with the provided reference info.

Effects on Linux / Mono:  None have been noted by anyone using patched EXE files as Linux Handles memory differently
but it is still subject to specific 32Bit limitations for 32Bit flavours.
