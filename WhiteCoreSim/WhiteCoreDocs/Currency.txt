Setting up Currency:

The currency module that has support for buying/selling land and objects
   with fake inworld currency.
As of WhiteCore Version 0.9.3, the currency module is enabled by default and is
  configured so that purchases do not cost anything

To modify the currency settings for your simulator, you need  to edit the
  'Economy.ini' file in the 'Modules' folder of your appropriate setup.

For Standalone simulators:
 Edit 'Config/Sim/Modules/Economy.ini'

For Grid installations:
  Edit 'Config/Grid/ServerConfiguration/Modules/Economy.ini'

  Note:  For grid configuration, it is not necessary to edit the standalone
    'Modules/Economy.ini' file.

The Economy.ini file is commented throughout but some of the common settings are...

PriceUpload        >> Price to upload a new object, mesh or texture
PriceGroupCreate   >> Price to create a new group
PriceDirectoryFee  >> Price to list a parcel in search (per week)
GroupPayments      >> Charge groups a directory search fee for listings
NewUserStipend     >> Pay new users an initial stipend on creation
PayStipends        >> Pay users a stipend periodically (default is once per week)
Stipend            >> Stipend amount to pay users
