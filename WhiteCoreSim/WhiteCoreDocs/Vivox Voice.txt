## How to set up your simulator to use Vivox Voice
##

Jump to the section below that corresponds to your setup.

##
## Standalone Setup
##

In 'Config/Sim/Modules/VoiceModules.ini', you will find at the top the
  [Voice] section. You will need to comment (put a ;) in front of
    Module = GenericVoice

  and remove the comment (the ;) in front of
    Module = VivoxVoice


  then, you will go to the section [VivoxVoice], and you will put
  in the server information you have received from Vivox.

  [VivoxVoice]
    ; vivox voice server
    vivox_server = theServer.vivox.com

    ; vivox SIP URI
    vivox_sip_uri = theServer.vivox.com

    ; vivox admin user name
    vivox_admin_user = YourAssignedUserName

    ; vivox admin password
    vivox_admin_password = YourVivixAccountPassword



##
## Grid setup
##

In 'Config/Grid/ServerConfiguration/Modules/VoiceModules.ini', you will find at
the top, the [Voice] section. You will need to comment (put a ;) in front of
    Module = GenericVoice

  and remove the comment (the ;) in front of
    Module = VivoxVoice

  then, you will go to the section [VivoxVoice], and you will put
  in the server information you have received from Vivox.

  [VivoxVoice]
    ; vivox voice server
    vivox_server = theServer.vivox.com

    ; vivox SIP URI
    vivox_sip_uri = theServer.vivox.com

    ; vivox admin user name
    vivox_admin_user = YourAssignedUserName

    ; vivox admin password
    vivox_admin_password = YourVivixAccountPassword

## Port forwarding
##
If you are running a firewall you may need to open the following ports to allow voice access
3478  UDP Voice/STUN traffic
3479  UDP Voice/STUN traffic
5060  UDP Voice/SIP traffic
5062  UDP Voice/SIP traffic
12000-17000 UDP Voice/RTP traffic

When you restart your simulator (grid/standalone) you should see the Vivox connection
  details similar to those shown below.
