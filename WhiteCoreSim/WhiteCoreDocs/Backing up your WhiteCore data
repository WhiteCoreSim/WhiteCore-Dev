Backing up your WhiteCore data
------------------------------

For standard installations the data structure is defined as ...

WhiteCoreSim
  - bin                      -- The main operating files
  - Config                   -- Configuration settings
  - Data                     -- Main data
  - WhiteCoreDocs            -- Documentation
  - WhiteCoreHelpers         -- Additional information
  - Various support files    -- *.bat, *.sh, *.txt


WhiteCore stores all necessary data in the 'Data' directory except for those installations that are using MySql/MariaDb for their volatile data (User details, inventory etc)

From your installation directory..

If you backup the entire 'Data' directory you will get most of the valid data.
This includes your region details, scripts, archives etc and also your assets if you are using the FileBased Asset system (the default)

The rest of the required data is stored in (probably) the MySql database.
These databases contain user settings, inventory, groups etc so you will need to dump the entire database to an external file using mysqldump, phpadmin or a similar process so that it can be restored if required. (I use Sequel Pro on the Mac)

E.G. Using the commandline 'mysqldump'
$ mysqldump -u whitecore -p whitecore > whitecore_backup.sql

The options are...
  -u whitecore  -- is the MySql user that can access the database (You may have changed this)
  -p            -- prompt for the database user password (default- whitecorepass.  You did change this I hope)
  whitecore     -- the database you are backing up
  whitecore_backup.sql  -- the sql dumpof the database.  Note: This can get very large

If you are using SQLite all this data is contined in the 'Data' directory and will be backed up using a standard file copy.

NOTE: If you use additional installations for seperate grid connected regions etc you will need to backup each of the relevant Data directories.

The Config directory does hold your current configuration setup.  This directory contains txt files and can be copied using your file manager.



The rest does not need to be backed up
--------------------------------------

All the rest of the scripts and directories in the top level installation directory are not really necessary as they can be reproduced by copying from your repo or a framework package.
e.g.: '..docs', '*.sh' etc

The 'bin' directory can be backed up if desired but this is the directory that will be overwritten if there is an update.
