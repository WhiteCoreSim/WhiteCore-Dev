# Converting from V0.9.2 configuration to the new V 0.9.3 configuration format


The basic structure...
-----------------------

Create a 'Config' folder
Cd to the new 'Config' folder
Create two additional folders, 'Grid' and 'Sim'

You should have the following....

       Config
         |
     ---------
     |        |
   Grid      Sim

Copying existing configuration to the new structure...
------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:
 If you have an 'ini' file you do not require the corresponding '*.ini.example' file
 However, if you have not created an 'ini' file you MUST copy the '*.ini.example'
  file in it's place.

Cd to your new 'Config' folder
Copy the following files from your existing 'bin' folder
 - WhiteCore.ini
 - WhiteCore.ini.example (optional if you have an 'ini')
 - WhiteCore.Server.ini
 - WhiteCore.Server.ini.example (optional if you have an 'ini')
 - shutdown_commands.txt (optional unless you use this feature)
 - startup_commands.txt  (optional unless you use this feature)

Cd to your new 'Config/Grid' folder
Copy the following files and folders from your existing 'bin' folder
 - SeverConfiguration folder and contents
 - WebServerConfiguration and contents
 - WhiteCore.AssetServer.ini.example
 - WhiteCore.AvatarServer.ini.example
 - WhiteCore.GridServer.ini.example
 - WhiteCore.InventoryServer.ini.example
 - WhiteCore.ServersBase.ini.example
 - WhiteCore.WebServer.ini.example

Cd to your new 'Config/Sim' folder
Copy the following folders and files from your existing 'bin/configuration' folder
 - Data folder and contents
 - Grid folder and contents
 - Modules folder and contents
 - Physics folder and contents
 - Scripting folder and contents
 - Standalone folder and contents
 - Includes.ini
 - Includes.ini.example
 - Main.ini
 - Main.ini.example

Now the hard part....
---------------------
You will need to compare your copied configuration data to the default configuration
in the 'WhiteCoreSim/Config' folder.
Using a file diff/merger program like 'DiffMerge' or similar will make this easier

Basically...
References to include files will have changed as follows...

Config folder
============
  'WhiteCore.ini'
    'Includes' directives
      = Configuration/*   ==>>  = Sim/*
  'WhiteCoreServer.ini'
     'Includes' directives
        = ServerConfiguration/*   ==>>  = Grid/ServerConfiguration/*

Grid folder
===========
 'Includes' directives
    = ServerConfiguration/*   ==>>  = Grid/ServerConfiguration/*
 SQLite.ini
     Data Source=file:*  ==>> Data Source=file:../Data/SQLite/*

 Specific things to check and modify...
   Grid/ServerConfiguration/AssetCache/FlotsamCache.ini
     ==>>   CacheDirectory = ../Data/AssetCache

   Grid/ServerConfiguration/Data/Data.ini
     ==>>   AssetFolderPath = 		No path (default) unless you have a special folder for your FileBased Assets

Sim folder
==========
 'Includes' directives
    = Configuration/*   ==>>  = Sim/*
 SQLite.ini
     Data Source=file:*  ==>> Data Source=file:../Data/SQLite/*

 Specific things to check and modify...
   'Sim/Data/FileBased.ini'
     ==>>  StoreBackupDirectory = "../Regions/"
	 ==>>  PreviousBackupDirectory = "../RegionBak/"

   'Sim/Grid/GridCommon.ini'  (Note: if you have 'WhiteCoreGridCommon.ini, rename to GridCommon.ini)
     ==>>   GridServerURI = "http://ServersHostname:8012/grid/"

   'Sim/Modules/AssetCache/FlotsamCache.ini
     ==>>   CacheDirectory = ../Data/AssetCache


I've probably missed something so please let me know so it can be corrected :)
