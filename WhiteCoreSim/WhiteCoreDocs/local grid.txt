To run WhiteCore in Grid mode on your local, internal network ip address, you need to specify the HostName address for both the Grid and region server.

Using 10.0.1.5 as the example local IP, but you should change it to your own, if it's different (e.g 192.168.0.100 etc.).

#
# Grid Configuration:
#

Set the HostName under the [Network] section in the WhiteCore.Server.ini, removing the 'comment' character if necessary.
e.g. HostName = 10.0.1.5

#
# Local Region server only: 
#

Set the HostName under the [Network] section in WhiteCore.ini, removing the 'comment' character if necessary.
e.g. HostName = 10.0.1.5

Specify grid mode operation in Config/Sim/Main.ini by commenting the Includes-Standalone and uncommenting the Includes-Grid lines

e.g.
    ;Include-Standalone = Sim/Standalone/StandaloneCommon.ini

    Include-Grid = Sim/Grid/GridCommon.ini
