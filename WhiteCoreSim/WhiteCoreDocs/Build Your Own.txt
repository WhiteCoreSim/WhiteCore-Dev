Building your own from source
=============================

Prerequisites
=============
Mono V3 +   : Checkout http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html for the latest update
(Optional)  Xamarin Studio for a nice IDE available for all OS's.
              Checkout http://http://monodevelop.com/Download

Building
========

Clone the WhiteCore repo at https://github.com/WhiteCoreSim/WhiteCore-Dev.git

# Windows #
Change to your download directory and run (double click) the 'runprebuild.bat' batch file
 (or 'runprebuildvs2015.bat' if you have Visual Studio 2015 installed)

At the completion of this process you will be asked if you wish to build immediately.
 If you wish to build later, a 'build' batch file will be created with the required
 configuration settings.


# *nix based systems #
Cd to the downloaded directory.
Run(Execute) the 'runprebuild.sh' file to create the required c# solution files.
#:  ./runprebuild.sh

Compile WhiteCore :
#:  xbuild WhiteCore.sln

Note: Alternatively you can use the 'autobuild.sh' script to configure and
 automatically build for your system configuration.


A large amount of compile information will be shown but when completed,
no errors should be indicated.
NOTE:  Some warnings may be shown but these do not present any problem or prevent
 operation of the servers.
 (These do depend upon the system used will be corrected and removed as time permits)

When completed the 'WhiteCoreSim/bin' subdirectory will contain the newly compiled WhiteCore files.

Copy the 'bin' subdirectory to your existing WhiteCore installation, replacing the 'bin' directory there.

Restart as per normal using the appropriate script file.
Answer 'No' if asked to re-configure at startup.

Checkout the ReadMe.txt file for the rest
