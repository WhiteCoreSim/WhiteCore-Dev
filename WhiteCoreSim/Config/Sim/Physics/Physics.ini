;;The Base FPS for the calculation of the TimeDilation. To find the best value for you, do the following:
;; Log into your sim,
;; Bring up the stats pop-up box in your viewer (control shift 1)
;; Look at the Physics FPS stat and find the average value of it (can be rough) and place it here
;;Normally, this value is around 45
BasePhysicsFPS = 45

;; These are the physics parameters for the physics engines.
;; BulletSim is the most advanced physics engine, but is currently not fully tested
