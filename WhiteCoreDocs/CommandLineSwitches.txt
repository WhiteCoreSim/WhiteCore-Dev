Startup CommandLine Switches for WhiteCore
You can use these switches with either WhiteCore.exe, WhiteCore.32BitLaunch.exe, and WhiteCore.Server.exe

;; Change the sim.sim file name (For WhiteCore.exe only)
WhiteCore.exe -RegionDataFileName=test.sim

;; Change the log file name from WhiteCore.log to WhiteCore<file>.log
;; For example
WhiteCore.exe -LogAppendName=test
;; Makes a log file with WhiteCoretest.log

;; Change the http port set
;; Overrides whatever is set in [Network]
WhiteCore.exe -http_listener_port=9000

;; Saves all merged .ini files into the bin directory for viewing
;; This creates a file in the BIN directory for each ini file loaded in Sequence
;; Examples
;;    WhiteCore.ini = ConfigFileDump1.ini
;;    Main.ini = ConfigFileDump2.ini
;; These are incremented according to to order of load and contain the parsed ini file contents.
;; !! Used only for Debugging and tracing ini flow path.  Do Not Use as a Normal Setting. !!
WhiteCore.exe -inidbg=true

;; Shows all .ini files as they are loaded on the console
WhiteCore.exe -inishowfileloading=true

;; New Style Command Line Functions for .ini configuration
;; Note: All .ini options also support putting a URL instead of a file path
;;Be mindful of these when modifying...
;;1) When file A includes file B, if the same directive is found in both, that the value in file B wins.
;;2) That any values for directives pulled in after a first file is loaded override directives of the same name found in the directive set 
;;    created by reading in the previous .ini file.

;; This option sets which folder on the hard drive the WhiteCore configuration files will be loaded from
;; The default option for this is the bin/ directory, which requires no option set here
;; This can be a full path
;; Example
WhiteCore.exe -mainIniDirectory=C:\Config

;; This option sets the name of the first .ini file to load
;; The default for this option is WhiteCore.ini
;; Example
WhiteCore.exe -mainIniFileName=WhiteCoreTesting.ini

;; This options sets the secondary file to load. This loads after the mainIniFileName file has loaded and can be used to override options from it
;; The default for this option is ""
;; Example
WhiteCore.exe -secondaryIniFileName=WhiteCoreSecondaryTesting.ini


;; Old Style Command line functions for .ini configuration
;; NOTE: YOU CANNOT MIX OLD AND NEW OPTIONS
;; These require "-oldoptions=true" to be added as well

WhiteCore.exe -oldoptions=true -inifile=MyIniOveride.ini
WhiteCore.exe -oldoptions=true -inigrid=MyIniOveride.ini
