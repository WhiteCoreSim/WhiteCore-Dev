# Clean install on a new VM of Ubuntu server 20.04 LTS
# Single user entered at creation
# requies the autobuild.sh to be edited as msbuild is not included with the
# latest mono so use xbuild is needed 
# This needs to be done prior to running this script

nano ./autobuild.sh

./autobuild.sh

# ... complie output

cp -R WhiteCoreSim ~/WhiteCoreSim
cd ~/WhiteCoreSim
cd ./bin
mono WhiteCore.Server.exe --reconfigure

# Enter configuration details as prompted

# re run the grid server to install assets and complete configurtion
mono WhiteCore.Server.exe

# The grid server will run, create and install the default assets into the database
# Wait until initial setup has been completed and the 'quit' the server
quit

# Restart the grid server in a screen session ready for configuring the region server next
cd ..
./run_gridservice.sh

# Output indicating screen session is running



##  Configure the region server ##
__________________________________

# Continue in the 'bin' directory
cd ./bin
mono WhiteCore.exe --reconfigure

# Check and confirm configuration
# Region server configuration is complete
#  Restart region server to complete configuration

mono WhiteCore.exe

# First region setup (home landing region)
...
# Exit the region
... quit

# restart the region server in a 'screen' session
cd ..     
./run_simservice.sh

# Output indicating screen session is running

# Login to the WhiteCore sim is now possible
You should now be able to use your favourite client to login with the user and password you set in the region setup.
Note: You will need to add your new grid to the client's grid options



You can check that the servers are up and running correctly by accessing the appropriate screen session  
screen -r Grid
screen -r Sim



You can use the combined startup script to run both the grid and region server
./run_gridmode.sh

This will run the grid server and the region server in seperate sessions


# Note:   If using SQLite, removing all the *.db files in Data/SQLite/ will reset so that the next time WhiteCore is run, the initial startup details will be requested.
i.e.  Removing the database will re-initialise the Sim to a 'clean' state
