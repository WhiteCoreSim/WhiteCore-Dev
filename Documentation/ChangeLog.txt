- Code cleanup

DotNetEngine

* Disabling the Stats for now, it seems that part still needs some additional work

DotNetEngine

* Update the engine so it can now serialize data into seperate AppDomains

Currency

* Fixing long lasting bug with Weekly Stipend Payments
- Problem was that RunEvery was picked up, multiplied by 7 and written back to the database with that value.
Next time the Scheduler would pick that value and multiply it again and using it as a multiplier to write a even further date in the future.

Currency

* Added a new function GetNextWeekDay which returns a DateTime in preparation for the Scheduler changes

Currency

* More cleaning to make things readable

Currency

* Cleaned up some "impossible" values as a Yearly schedule would be enough
