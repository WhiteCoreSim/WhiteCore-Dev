Building your own from source
=============================

The main development repository is at https://github.com/WhiteCoreSim/WhiteCore-Dev.git
Release packages at https://github.com/WhiteCoreSim/WhiteCore-Dev/releases

Prerequisites
=============
Mono V3.x    : Checkout http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html for the latest update
				Mono 2.8.10 available with Ubuntu variations will also work
(Optional)  Xamarin Studio for a nice IDE : Checkout http://http://monodevelop.com/Download

Building
========
Cd into the downloaded directory.

Make sure you have the WhiteCoreSim/WhiteCore-LibOMV downloaded and unpacked as well in this folder.

*nix (inc Mac)
--------------
Run(Execute) the  ./runprebuild.sh file to create the required c# solution files.

Compile WhiteCore :
#:  xbuild WhiteCore.sln

Windows
-------
Run(Execute) the  'runprebuild.bat' batch file.  This will ask several questions 
with the option to build at the end.

A large amount of compile information will be shown but when completed, 
no errors should be indicated.

NOTE:  Some warnings may be shown (37 at last count) but these do not present 
any problem or prevent operation of the servers. 
(These will be corrected and removed as time permits)

When completed the 'WhiteCoreSim/bin' subdirectory will contain the newly compiled WhiteCore files.

Running for the first time
--------------------------
If you are not running this for the first time and already have a configured WhiteCore installation, skip
 to the next section.
 
Copy the entire WhiteCoreSim directory to a location of your choice, for example..

.. for Un*x systems (inc. Mac OS X): (terminal)  to copy to your user home directory..

  >>  cp WhiteCoreSim ~/ 

.. or in your GUI, copy the WhiteCoreSim directory and paste where desired.

Start WhiteCore (Standalone) using the appropriate script file for your system.
If you need to tailor your configuration, answer yes when asked if you want to auto-configure.


For an existing installation
----------------------------
Copy the 'WhiteCoreSim/bin' subdirectory to your existing WhiteCore installation, replacing the 'bin' directory there.

Restart as per normal using the appropriate script file.
Answer 'No' if asked to re-configure at startup.

Checkout the ReadMe.txt file for the rest
